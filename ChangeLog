    * Password support: You can now connect to servers with
    passwords. Based on a patch by Benjamin Meyer.

May 10, 2005: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Playlist support: Fetch playlists on connect and provide
    APIs for accessing playlists.
    * Security Fixes: Fix several possible buffer overflows.
    * Better handling of HTTP error codes: Pass error codes
    back as return values

January 29, 2005: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Solaris fixes: Ensure integers are properly aligned
    when necessary. Based on code by Rico Pajarola.
    * Various bug fixes: Based on code by Rico Pajarola.

January 27, 2005: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Add configure check for various integer types.
    * Various mdnsd fixes: Add a flag to the query callback
    to determine if the record was added or removed, define
    various class types, understand unicast responses,
    add some debugging information, answer cached answers
    to questions that we already have - on first time send
    of query.

January 7, 2005: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Replace Apple's mDNS with mdnsd: mdnsd is a free mdns
    implementation. libopendaap can now be considered entirely free

January 4, 2005: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Improve debugging support: Create an API to turn on and
    off debug options.
    * Add manpage: Add a basic man page. Initial work done by
    Simon Freiberg <fryboy AT optusnet DOT com DOT au>.
    * Some small build fixes.

December 16, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Fix some threading issues: Unlock mutex before calling callback
    in the ioloop. Use a recursive mutex in the ioloop.
    * Remove thread timer: This frees up a thread that was never
    being used.
    * Improved debug traces: Now properly optional based on debug
    class.

December 13, 2004: Daniel Drake <dsd AT gentoo DOT org>
    * Fix some header problems.

December 13, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Watch remote hosts for updates: This includes the creation
    of a custom ioloop to watch as many clients as we've been
    asked to in a single thread. Currently we don't handle updates
    properly.
    * Fix bug where suddenly iTunes would refuse to serve us:
    This is a consequence of the above work.
    * Fix some haader problems.

November 8, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Can connect to mt-daapd servers: Address a few issues
    where mt-daapd fails to return fields that iTunes always does.
    Strictly speaking, most were mt-daapd bugs, but we work around
    them now.

    * Sends errors as status callbacks to application.
    * Handle more error possiblities in HTTP connections.

October 10, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Now connects on the advertised port, not the default.

August 1, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Fix crash on connecting to machines with AAC files:
    we were using the wrong type for songformat when testing
    its size.

July 31, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Add support for hosts going away: Properly remove remote
    hosts from the host list when they are no longer available.
    * More robust HTTP connections: Every time we get a file
    it needs to be retrieved over its own HTTP connection.
    * Add support for other file types: The file type is given
    to the application and it must pass it back to us. This change
    has been sent to me by many people, so I figure it was time
    to put it in.

July 31, 2004: Chriss Barnett <chris.barnett AT gmail DOT com>
    * Various XBOX fixes: Mostly compile fixes merged in for now.
    Also fixed 4.5 hash generation for non-async file gets.

June 6, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Don't pretend we're downloading when we aren't: Send the
    negotiating signal before the downloading signal, so the
    app knows when downloading has started.
    * Portability: Create a thread abstraction layer.
    * Update mDNS: New mDNS.c file from Apple
    * Make libopendaap build on Windows: Now builds in MS VC++
    version 6. Includes many build changes and the reimplementation
    of the discovery class using DNSServiceDiscovery API.

June 5, 2004: David Moore <dcm AT mit DOT edu>
    * Fix discovery race: Should solve crashing on multiple hosts.

May 5, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Fix for big endian machines (like Macs): Swap bytes
    in the MD5 hash generation, even on big endian machines.

April 29, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Update for iTunes 4.5: New authentication module, using
    a non-kosher MD5 algorithm and new tricks.
    Also fix up some protocol changes.
    * Better support for multiple hosts: Don't crash all the
    time when multiple hosts exist on the network.

April 13, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Initial work to build with mdnsd: Imported their sources
    and build them. Don't actually use them yet. (incomplete)
    * Initial work to get playlists: We can get the playlists,
    but we don't deal with them yet. (incomplete)

April 13, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Compile fixes for OSX: Check for sockaddr.sa_len and
    do endian checks / correct swappings.

April 1, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Fix crash on BSD machines: Initilize an unused mutex

April 1, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Allow cancelation of song downloads: iTunes allows
    one to disconnect and reconnect if you specify the
    Connection: Close header (only works on getting a song).
    This allows us to interupt the getting of songs.

March 30, 2004: Derrick J Brashear <shadow AT dementia DOT org>
    * Fix for bad IP addresses: Use unsigned byte not signed,
    so IPs with any element greater than 128 works.

March 10, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>

    * Don't automatically connect on discover: Hosts are not
    automatically connected to on discovery anymore, rather
    only their connection details and 'share name' are stored
    until the app asks to connect to them. Changes API to
    the extent of breaking any existing apps.

March 10, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>

    * Don't crash on dodgy host: Fixes problems with crashing
    when a host that requires authentication or something
    exists on the network.

March 1, 2004: Thor Sigvaldason <thor AT sigvaldason DOT com>

    * Change MD5 Function anmes: In order to avoid
    a symbol conflict when linking against other libs
    that implement the MD5 stuff.

Feburary 29, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>

    * Initial release.
